Changes:
- dnsmasq:
    Restart in dnsmasq unit-file (/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/dnsmasq.service) due to late ip-address assignment (dnsmasq runs with --bind-interface, we only want to provide dns-caching for wireless clients from iface wlan0, but since dhcpcd initiates its own static ip very late in the boot process and dnsmasq is set to type=fork, we are unable to set the dependency right)
- SSH:
    Set PermitRootLogin to "no" and remove ecdsa and dsa host keys and references in config
